This repository contains a collection of commonly used data structures implemented in C. The purpose of this library is to provide efficient, reusable implementations of fundamental data structures, enabling developers to focus on algorithmic problem-solving rather than low-level implementation details. Each data structure is implemented with a focus on performance, memory management, and ease of use. The library includes classic structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables, along with accompanying documentation and examples for each structure. Whether you're a student learning about data structures or a seasoned developer looking for reliable implementations, this library aims to be a valuable resource for your C projects.
